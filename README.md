# GAN-BERT for Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
**GAN-BERT** is a hybrid model that combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the BERT Transformer architecture for semi-supervised text classification. This repository includes scripts for training a teacher-student model using knowledge distillation, as well as visualizing data analysis and model performance

## Key Features
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** for enhanced data generation in semi-supervised learning.
- **BERT-based Teacher Model** for high-performance pre-trained language understanding.
- **Student Model with Knowledge Distillation** to transfer knowledge from the teacher to a lightweight model.
- **Data Analysis** to explore and visualize the dataset prior to model training.
- **Visualizations** to evaluate model performance and data characteristics.
